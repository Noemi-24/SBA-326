## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device’s screen size

### What I learned

During this project, I strengthened my understanding of:

- Implementing high-fidelity designs from Figma
- Creating responsive layouts using Bootstrap
- Building mobile navigation menus with Offcanvas

### AI Collaboration

During this project, I used ChatGPT to support my learning and problem-solving process.

How I used AI:

- Debugging responsive layout and menu issues
- Understanding Bootstrap components
- Improving CSS styling
- Refining project documentation

What worked well:

- Step-by-step explanations
- Clear code examples
- Fast feedback

What didn’t work well:

- Some suggestions needed customization to fit the design exactly

Overall, AI tools helped me learn faster while maintaining control over my code.
